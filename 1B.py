# B. NO to NO2 ratio (4 points: 2/1/1)
# The ratio between NO and NO2 can be calculated by the following three main fast reactions
# (here O is equal to O(3
# P)).
# NO + O3 → NO2 + O2 (1)
# NO2 + hv → NO + O (2)
# NO2 + O → NO + O2 (3)
# 1) Formulate a differential equation for NO on the basis of these 3 reactions, only. Steady-state
# can be assumed, since the reactions are fast enough with respect to the 1-hour timestep.



# 2) Derive formulations for the ratio NO:NO2 and the ratio NO:NOx , based on 1). Steady-state can
# be assumed, since the reactions are fast enough with respect to the 1-hour timestep.
# 3) Calculate the exact values of the ratios in B.2).
# (Assume a NO:NO2 ratio of 30% in the following.)
